## Overview

A landing page where a user can enter his/hers card details and see then displayed on the side. The user is also shown a completed display when the form is succesfully completed, plus a dark mode and some animations. Finally this landing page is suitable for all devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
- Add dark-mode, style elements accordingly
- Add animations, card elements etc.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript
- DOM API

### What I learned

Elements can have ```:valid``` ```:invalid``` pseudoselectors as well as the pseudoselectors themselves.

```css
.proud-of-this-css:focus:invalid {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
In this example when the class proud-of-this-css is focused but has an invalid value it's text color is changed.
